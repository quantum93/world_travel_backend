# _World Travel Application_

#### _Project for Week 12 at the coding school, Epicodus, written on August 22, 2019._

#### By _**Tae Lee and Alex Siegberg**_

# Description
_A website for (fictional) world travel information created using Ruby on Rails.
In particular, this website informed about the countries in the world from traveler. Each traveler gives rating by their experience and written comments. You can visit the random country site within this website. In order to use this website, you need two git repos (world_travel_backend and world_travel_interface). The backend logic was tested with the integration test spec for API call._

# Database
_The site should have functionality to review countries but your database should have built-in list of countries (check deployment instructions). All reviews should have an author, comments and rating. (A rating can be a number between 1 and 10.) You can include other fields of your choosing as well._

# Scopes
_This site should use scopes to display the following information on the site:_
_The country with the most reviews._
_The country with highest averaged ratings from travelers._
_A suggestion of country to visit by random selection_

# Seeding
_This project should include seed data for 195 countries with 5 to 25 250 reviews. Use Faker with a loop to seed the database._

* Deployment instructions
_For API service back-end, execute rails server with port number 3001 in same machine with interface._
_rails s -p 3001_
_For interface, execute rails server with port number 3000 in same machine with interface._
_rails s_
